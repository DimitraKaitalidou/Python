# My K-Means

This is a K-Means implementation that contains the development of a K-Means algorithm from scratch and its comparison with the scikit-learn K-Means algorithm. The data are initialized randomly, while the number of datapoints and the number of clusters are given by the user. The initial centroids are randomly selected from data. At the end, the script outputs the scatterplots of the clustering result of the two implementations.
